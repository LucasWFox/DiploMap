# DiploMap

A flask and folium project that uses maps as a tool to inform the masses on global conflicts

## Max if you see this:
In templates there is 2 html files ukraine.html and home_pins.html if you can merge them we could use it as a proof of consept.<br/>
When pins are clicked in home_pins.html they run a JS function OnClick(e) <br/>
If you can change the pin map to the ukraine map when OnClick is run then it should work.
